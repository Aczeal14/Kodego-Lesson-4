      Internet is Easy!
    </h1>
    <p>
      First, we need to learn basic HTML.
    </p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      Headings define the outline of your site, There are six levels of headings.
    </p>
  
    <h2>List</h2>
    <p>
      This is how you make an unordered list:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element(it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in a particular order</li>
         
    </ul>

    <p>
     This is what an ordered list looks like:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything </li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in this percise order, beacause this is an ordered list</li>
          
    </ol>
    <h2>Inline Element</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Sometimes</em>, yous need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other times, you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of the word or phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em>
    </p>
    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>
